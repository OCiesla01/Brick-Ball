# Brick Ball
_Brick ball is a recreation of the popular games like **Arkanoid** or **Breakout**._

_The player's goal in this game is to clear the stage by destroying all the bricks on the screen, using a ball that can be bounced off the walls and off the paddle that the player can control._

***Brick ball is one of my first projects in Unity**

***V0.1***
The basic functionality of the game has been created - the ball can move and bounce accordingly, the player can control the paddle, a prefabricated brick with the ability to change colors has been created
